#Augmented Image Project
This repository contains code and resources for performing image augmentation techniques to enhance datasets for computer vision tasks.

Overview
Image augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size and quality of image datasets by applying random transformations such as rotation, flipping, scaling, and more. This helps improve the performance and generalization of machine learning models.

Features
Rotation

Flipping (horizontal, vertical)

Scaling and resizing

Color adjustments (brightness, contrast)

Random cropping

Customizable augmentation pipeline

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

OpenCV

NumPy

[Any other libraries you use]

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/maheswari-f74/augumented-img-.git
cd augumented-img-

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate (On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate)

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the main script with your image directory as input:
python augment_images.py --input_folder path/to/images --output_folder path/to/save/augmented_images

You can customize augmentation parameters inside the script or via command line arguments (if implemented).
